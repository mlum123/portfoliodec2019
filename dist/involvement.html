                  For instance, after I wrote an article about the benefits of
                  multi-factor authentication, Scripps College began
                  implementing a multi-factor authentication system for students
                  and faculty, and cited my article. I have also written about
                  mental health and student wellbeing at HMC. In my first year, I wrote 15 Opinions articles.

                  One of my favorite stories to date was one that I wrote about
                  an 81-year-old auditor in my introductory CS class. I met him
                  at a tutoring session for that class, and I'm thankful to have
                  gotten to know him through interviews and wonderful
                  conversations. He has many lessons to
                  share, and I was glad to have the opportunity
                  to tell his story.

                  In March 2020, when we had to leave campus due to COVID-19, we were in the final stages of production. I pushed hard to complete 10 pages of design in just a few days, in the hopes of bringing some cheer to Mudd community members through the newspaper.

                  After talking to a dining hall worker one Sunday, I was inspired
                  to create a Humans of New York-style page for my college to spread

                  I'm an active member of the Claremont colleges' rock climbing
                  team. When I started college, I wanted to try new things, get
                  out of my comfort zone, and challenge myself. Climbing was the
                  perfect way for me to do that.
                </p>
                <p>My team
                  focuses on bouldering, which is a type of rock
                  climbing where we don't use any equipment, save for climbing
                  shoes. As someone who easily becomes afraid, when I'm at the top of a wall and need to come back
                  down, I sometimes wonder why I chose this activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Climbing isn't easy, but it's pretty amazing to be able to do
                  things that you never thought you could do. Each climb is
                  a problem: how do I start, what are the best holds to use, and
                  where should I put my hands and feet each step of the way up?

                <p>
                  I've played tennis since elementary school, and I haven't lost
                  my love for the sport. I played tennis for my school all four years
                  of high school and was captain of the varsity team
                  in my senior year. Upon entering college, I joined the club tennis
                  team of the Claremont colleges.

                <p>
                  I love being out at the courts and hitting with my teammates
                  and friends. When I'm on the court, I feel at peace. Nothing matters but the next ball to hit. I can
                  forget about everything except the game, which requires focus
                  and strategy to be played well.
                </p>
                <p>Club tennis is a great way for
                  me to relax and get some exercise, while making friends with
                  students from all the Claremont colleges.
