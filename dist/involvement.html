              I represent the Harvey Mudd College Class of 2023 and am a member
              of the Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College (ASHMC), the
              student government at HMC. My responsibilities and goals include
              attending weekly ASHMC Senate meetings to make decisions
              benefitting the HMC student body, organizing events for class
              unity, helping integrate the Class of 2023 into the Claremont
              community, and fostering relationships with professors.

              As a member of the Claremont colleges' Women in Computer Science
              student organization's leadership team, I help female students at
              the 5Cs find opportunities in computer science. This involves
              interfacing with companies and organizing events. For example, I
              planned and organized a highly successful HackerRank and Technical
              Interview Workshop for the group to learn more about the technical
              internship and job hiring process and how to approach coding
              challenges and technical interviews. 40 students attended.

              I am a front-end developer for the Study Cloud website team at
              HMC. We are a student-run club that is creating a website called
              Study Cloud to allow students to share study materials. For Study
              Cloud, I work mainly with HTML, CSS, and Sass. I am currently
              working on making the website more aesthetically pleasing, which
              is a great project for me given my interest in design.

              I am a member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) at HMC. We
              advocate for female students looking to major and find careers in
              technical fields like engineering and computer science. I actively
              attend SWE events, like sessions with companies, workshops,
              socials, and dinners, so that I can get to know other passionate
              female tech students at HMC and find new opportunities for me to
              grow as an engineer.

              One of my favorite stories to date was one that I wrote about an
              81-year-old auditor in my CS 5 Gold class. I met him at a tutoring
              sessions for that introductory CS class, and through interviews
              and CS lectures, I got to know him. He has an incredible life
              story and many lessons to share with the world, and I'm glad that
              I was able to have the opportunity to tell his story.

              I am an Opinions Writer for <i>The Student Life</i> newspaper of
              all seven Claremont Colleges. I love writing for opinions because
              it allows me to shed light on important issues in my community and

              should be resolved.

              For instance, after I wrote an article about the benefits of
              multi-factor authentication, Scripps College began implementing a
              multi-factor authentication system for students and faculty, and
              cited my article. I have also written about printing issues,
              campus safety, and mental health and student wellbeing at HMC.

I lead weekly tours of my college to introduce prospective students to HMC and inform visitors about HMC's unique status as a liberal arts college specializing in STEM, as well as our incredible professors, engaging and challenging courses, and collaborative and supportive community.</p>
            <p>I love HMC, and I enjoy being a tour guide because I can provide visitors with more insight into the unique and amazing HMC I know. In general, I deeply enjoy talking to others and getting to know people.  I extend my enthusiasm for meeting new people to my job as a tour guide, making visitors feel welcome and comfortable during their time at Mudd.</p>
