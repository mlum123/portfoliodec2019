              I represent the HMC Class of 2023 and am a member of the
              Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College (ASHMC), the HMC
              student government. My responsibilities and goals include
              attending weekly ASHMC Senate meetings to make decisions
              benefitting the HMC student body, organizing events for class
              unity, helping integrate the Class of 2023 into the Claremont
              community, and fostering relationships with professors.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm happy to be in a position where I can positively impact my

              As a member of the Claremont colleges' Women in Computer Science
              student organization's leadership team, I help female students at
              the 5Cs find opportunities in computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
              This involves interfacing with companies and organizing and
              promoting events like information sessions with companies,
              workshops, professor dinners, and socials. For example, I planned
              and organized a highly successful HackerRank and Technical
              Interview Workshop for the group to learn more about the technical
              internship and job hiring process and how to approach coding
              challenges and technical interviews. 40 students attended.

              I'm heavily involved in student journalism at the Claremont
              colleges. I write, edit, design, and take photos for HMC's
              <i>The Muddraker</i> newspaper. I love being able to capture

              One of my favorite stories to date was one that I wrote about an

              tutoring session for that class, and I'm thankful to have gotten
              to know him through interviews and wonderful conversations. He is
              incredibly sweet and has many lessons to share with the world, and
              I was glad to have the opportunity to tell his story.

              I am an Opinions Writer for <i>The Student Life</i> newspaper of

          <div class="fact climbing">
            <h4>claremont climbing team (5c)</h4>
            <h5>september 2019 - present</h5>
            <p>
              I'm an active member of the Claremont colleges' rock climbing
              team. When I started college, I wanted to try new things, get out
              of my comfort zone, and challenge myself. Climbing was the perfect
              way for me to achieve these personal goals. My team primarily
              focuses on bouldering, which is a type of rock climbing where we
              don't use any equipment, save for climbing shoes. As someone who
              easily becomes afraid at the smallest things, when I'm at the top
              of a wall and need to come back down, I sometimes wonder why I
              chose to do this to myself. But that's a big reason why climbing
              appeals so much to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Climbing isn't easy, but I see myself making progress every time
              I'm at the gym. It's pretty amazing to be able to do things that
              you never thought you could do. And each climb is a problem: how
              do I start, what are the best holds to use, and where should I put
              my hands and feet each step of the way up? The climbing team is
              also a great way for me to form meaningful bonds with people from
              the other Claremont colleges.

            <h4>club tennis (5c)</h4>
            <h5>september 2019 - present</h5>
            <p>
              Having played tennis since elementary school, I haven't lost my
              love for the sport. I played tennis for my school team all four
              years of high school and was captain of the varsity team in my
              senior year of high school. I didn't want to lose tennis, so upon
              entering college, I joined the club tennis team of the Claremont
              colleges.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love being out at the courts and hitting with my teammates and
              friends. When I'm on the court, I feel at peace, even with the
              craziness and stress that can often be a part of my life at
              college. Nothing matters but the next ball to hit. I can forget
              about everything except the game, which requires focus and
              strategy to be played well. Club tennis is a great way for me to
              relax and get some exercise, while making friends with students
              from all the Claremont colleges.
