              I represent the Harvey Mudd College Class of 2023 and am a member
              of the Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College (ASHMC), the
              student government at HMC. My responsibilities and goals include
              attending weekly ASHMC Senate meetings to make decisions
              benefitting the HMC student body, organizing events for class
              unity, helping integrate the Class of 2023 into the Claremont
              community, and fostering relationships with professors.

              I'm heavily involved in student journalism at the Claremont
              colleges. I write, edit, design, and take photos for HMC's
              <i>The Muddraker</i> newspaper. I love being able to capture
              stories in my community.

              One of my favorite stories to date was one that I wrote about an
              81-year-old auditor in my CS 5 Gold class. I met him at a tutoring
              sessions for that introductory CS class, and through interviews
              and CS lectures, I got to know him. He has an incredible life
              story and many lessons to share with the world, and I'm glad that
              I was able to have the opportunity to tell his story.

              I am an Opinions Writer for <i>The Student Life</i> newspaper of
              all seven Claremont Colleges. I love writing for opinions because
              it allows me to shed light on important issues in my community and
              work toward improving student life and addressing problems that my
              should be resolved.

              For instance, after I wrote an article about the benefits of
              multi-factor authentication, Scripps College began implementing a
              multi-factor authentication system for students and faculty, and
              cited my article. I have also written about printing issues,
              campus safety, and mental health and student wellbeing at HMC.
