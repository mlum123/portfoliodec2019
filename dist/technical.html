                <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I designed a full-stack web application called Neighborhood to allow neighbors to help each other out by posting their needs and offers of help.</p>
                  <p>As I began noticing shortages of items like flour and yeast, I wanted to help out in my own way during the pandemic.</p>
                  <p>I was also inspired by informal exchanges of baked goods and packs of Costco mozzarella cheese that I had been having with my friends since quarantine began, as well as my mom's grocery runs for elderly neighbors.</p>
                  <p>The thought sprung into my mind that I could create an online platform for neighbors to help each other out, so I built Neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>I used MongoDB and Express for the backend, React for the frontend, Redux for state management, JSON Web Tokens for user authentication, and Reactstrap to integrate Bootstrap components with React, in a Node.js environment. I also used Mongoose.</p>

                  <p>Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, I designed and built the dashboard and module pages, and integrated gamification (multiple choice quiz questions) into the project to make the onboarding process more engaging.</p>
                  <p>This onboarding console will be used by the 7000+ women in computer science in the RTC community so that they can learn about RTC professional guidelines when they join RTC, which seeks to promote and uplift women in computer science.</p>

                  And amid the coronavirus crisis, I've become even more concerned about fake news circulating on the web because of false theories about the virus that may cause people to participate in unsafe behavior.</p>
                  <p>So, combining my passion for tech with an interest in journalism, I built a news aggregator web application using Angular and the News API.</p>
                  <p>One of my goals for the summer of 2020 was to learn web development frameworks, so I taught myself Angular.</p>
                  <p>My News Aggregator app is component-based, and I used Angular services to make HTTP requests to the News API, and thus display automatically updated top headlines.</p>
                  <p>My app also allows users to search for news topics from trusted publications, and research and vet publications.</p>

                <p>
                  As one of 36 students chosen to attend the 2018 Summer Science
                  Program in Astrophysics in New Mexico, I used Etscorn
                  Observatory's Celestron-14 telescope to observe near-Earth
                  asteroid 2002 UX and calculate its position (in right ascension
                  and declination) throughout the summer. Due to its dimness, 2002
                  UX was a particularly difficult asteroid to track.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the data I collected, I used Python to determine the asteroid's
                  orbital elements that uniquely define its orbit through the iterative
                  Method of Gauss. I used differential correction to improve calculations
                  of the orbital elements, and calculated uncertainties with Monte Carlo
                  sampling. I successfully determined and visualized the orbit of 2002 UX.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, I used Swift integration software to perform
                  orbital integration and run multiple simulations to determine
                  what might happen to 2002 UX after many years. I discovered that
                  2002 UX had probabilities of colliding with the Earth, Sun,
                  Venus, and Mars.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My team published the data we had collected on the positions of
                  asteroid 2002 UX in the Minor Planet Center Supplement:

              At COSMOS UC Davis, I was in Cluster 1: Quantum Mechanics and
              Applications to Nanotechnology.
            </p>
            <p> I learned to program in C and
              also learned basics in electronics. My time at COSMOS culminated
              in building a scanning tunneling microscope
              (STM) to take 3D images of surfaces at the atomic level. The STM
              uses the quantum effect of tunneling by applying a voltage
              between the STM's conducting tip and the surface of the sample
              being studied. This voltage sends electrons to the sample
              surface. I used C for the software side of the project. My STM
              successfully took images of samples at microscopic levels and
              could be used to conduct more research in nanotechnology.
