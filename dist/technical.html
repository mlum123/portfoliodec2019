                <p>As part of Rewriting the Code's (RTC) Rewrite Your Summer program, I designed an onboarding console that involved gamification of professional etiquette guidelines provided by RTC.
                  After analyzing data from a survey of RTC Fellows and members about the current RTC onboarding process, I divided up essential material into 5 critical modules and created questions and scenarios for each module to reinforce the information in each.
                  Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, I designed and built the dashboard and module pages, and integrated the gamification (multiple choice quiz questions) into the project.
                  This onboarding console will be used by the 7000+ women in computer science in the RTC community so that they can learn about RTC professional guidelines when they join RTC, which seeks to promote and uplift women in computer science.<p>

                <p>
                  As one of 36 students chosen to attend the 2018 Summer Science
                  Program in Astrophysics in New Mexico, I used Etscorn
                  Observatory's Celestron-14 telescope to observe near-Earth
                  asteroid 2002 UX and calculate its position (in right ascension
                  and declination) throughout the summer. Due to its dimness, 2002
                  UX was a particularly difficult asteroid to track.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With data collected from observations of the asteroid, I used
                  Python to determine the asteroid's six orbital elements that
                  uniquely define its orbit through the iterative Method of Gauss. I
                  used differential correction to improve calculations of the
                  orbital elements, and calculated the uncertainties of the orbital
                  elements with Monte Carlo sampling. I successfully determined the
                  orbit of 2002 UX, in addition to visualizing its orbit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, I used Swift integration software to perform orbital
                  integration and run multiple simulations to determine what might
                  happen to 2002 UX after many years. I discovered that 2002 UX had
                  probabilities of colliding with the Earth, Sun, Venus, and Mars,
                  which may impact the solar system, as well as the properties of
                  each of these bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My team published the data we had collected on the positions of
                  asteroid 2002 UX in the Minor Planet Center Supplement:

                  on how we had collected data on asteroid 2002 UX and determined
                  its orbit.

            <p>At COSMOS UC Davis, I was in Cluster 1: Quantum Mechanics and
              Applications to Nanotechnology. I learned to program in C and also
              learned basics in electronics. My time at COSMOS culminated in a
              final project of building a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to
              take 3D images of surfaces at the atomic level. The STM uses the
              quantum effect of tunneling by applying a voltage between the
              STM's conducting tip and the surface of the sample being studied.
              This voltage sends electrons to the sample surface. On the
              electronics side, I built a 15V power supply. I also used C for
              the software side of the project. My STM successfully took images
              of samples at microscopic levels and could be potentially used to
              conduct more research in the sphere of nanotechnology.</p>
