              computer security company with products for privileged access
              management (PAM) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), I fixed

              control software. Additionally, I wrote unit tests in Go. One of
              my biggest accomplishments during my time at Centrify was
              restructuring the codebase to use interfaces and introducing mocks
              in unit tests to increase code coverage of unit tests.
