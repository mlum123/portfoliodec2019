              As a Software Development Intern for Centrify Corporation, a
              computer security company with products for privileged access
              management (PAM) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), I fixed
              bugs, using JIRA issue tracking software and Perforce version
              control software. Additionally, I wrote unit tests in Go. One of
              my biggest accomplishments during my time at Centrify was
              restructuring the codebase to use interfaces and introducing mocks
              in unit tests to increase code coverage of unit tests.

              The Summer Science Program - Astrophysics Researcher
            </h3>
            <p>
              As one of 36 students chosen to attend the 2018 Summer Science
              Program in Astrophysics in New Mexico, I used Etscorn
              Observatory's Celestron-14 telescope to observe near-Earth
              asteroid 2002 UX and calculate its position (in right ascension
              and declination) throughout the summer. Due to its dimness, 2002
              UX was a particularly difficult asteroid to track.
            </p>
            <p>
              With data collected from observations of the asteroid, I used
              Python to determine the asteroid's six orbital elements that
              uniquely define its orbit through the iterative Method of Gauss. I
              used differential correction to improve calculations of the
              orbital elements, and calculated the uncertainties of the orbital
              elements with Monte Carlo sampling. I successfully determined the
              orbit of 2002 UX, in addition to visualizing its orbit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I used Swift integration software to perform orbital
              integration and run multiple simulations to determine what might
              happen to 2002 UX after many years. I discovered that 2002 UX had
              probabilities of colliding with the Earth, Sun, Venus, and Mars,
              which may impact the solar system, as well as the properties of
              each of these bodies.
            </p>
            <p>
              My team published the data we had collected on the positions of
              asteroid 2002 UX in the Minor Planet Center Supplement:

              California State Summer School for Mathematics & Science (COSMOS)
              UC Davis - Researcher
            </h3>
            <p>
              At COSMOS UC Davis, I was in Cluster 1: Quantum Mechanics and
              Applications to Nanotechnology. I learned to program in C and also
              learned basics in electronics. My time at COSMOS culminated in a
              final project of building a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to
              take 3D images of surfaces at the atomic level. The STM uses the
              quantum effect of tunneling by applying a voltage between the
              STM's conducting tip and the surface of the sample being studied.
              This voltage sends electrons to the sample surface. On the
              electronics side, I built a 15V power supply. I also used C for
              the software side of the project. My STM successfully took images
              of samples at microscopic levels and could be potentially used to
              conduct more research in the sphere of nanotechnology.

              As the Editor-in-Chief of <i>the Epic</i>, the Lynbrook High
              School student newspaper, I oversaw 38 student journalists and 5
              sections (news, opinion, features, in-depth, and sports), online
              and in print (8 issues per year). My responsibilities included
              directing the newspaper in my vision; representing the newspaper
              professionally; maintaining relationships with school
              administration and other community members; editing articles
              multiple times per issue cycle; teaching staffers how to write
              journalistically, conduct interviews, and use graphic design
              software; and providing staffers with feedback on their articles,
              layouts, and teamwork. During my time on staff, I wrote and
              published 20+ articles, created layouts using Adobe Photoshop and
              InDesign, and took numerous photographs to accompany articles. I
              was Opinion Section Editor for the 2017-2018 school year, and then
              Editor-in-Chief for the 2018-2019 school year.
